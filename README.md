House Price Prediction Model
After 7 years in the real estate industry, I transitioned my career to data science, merging my domain expertise with newfound skills. This project showcases a powerful house price prediction model that combines my in-depth knowledge of the real estate market with advanced data science techniques.

Description
The house prediction model leverages a comprehensive dataset encompassing various factors influencing property prices, including size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, floor details, and amenities. Through meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing, I ensured the dataset's quality and consistency.

Employing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the model accurately estimates housing prices based on the provided features. Feature selection techniques were implemented to identify the most influential factors, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.

To validate the model's performance, rigorous testing was conducted using cross-validation and performance metrics analysis. This ensured its reliability and generalization across diverse real estate scenarios.

To facilitate effortless utilization, I developed an intuitive user interface using Streamlit. This interactive web application allows users to input property features and promptly obtain predicted housing prices, providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and industry professionals.

This project represents a culmination of my expertise in real estate and data science, showcasing the potential of merging domain knowledge with advanced analytical techniques to drive accurate predictions in the housing market.
